playhtml5vid

Uses video.js to play a video in it's own window.

Path of filename should be relative to path of this file.
Video-files must be mp4 or mov.

A jpg-file with the same name as the videofile is used as placeholder, also it's dimensions are used.

If this is an iframe in the same domain, some changes are made to the parent frame to get the aspect ratio right and enable fullscreen HTML5 video.
